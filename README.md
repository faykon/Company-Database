# Company-Database Sql/MySql/PopSql
I created this database after finishing a youtube course! 

First we have to install Mysql and set a username and a password
Then we open MySql cmd line to create our server. After we create our database by typing create database company;(company is the name that we want to give in our database)
We install PopSql so we can visualize our database
Setting type Mysql
Hostname Localhost
Database: company(the name we choose)
Username: root
Password: The password we put when installing MySql
Then we can write the code given below to create our tables!
